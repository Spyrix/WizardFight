Features to Implement:

Enable spells to be insta-cast, for the future
Game Sounds
Game Music
two complete stages
four new spells

Polish:
Jump animation

Bugs to fix:
Camera shakes sometimes, especially when there's rigidbody bs happening
players can collide with objects and climb them? Rigidbody BS
Ensure that spell select cursors do not move out of camera sight
Unplugging a controller should cause the game to pause and NOT CRASH
Get rid of all warnings in console
try to remove gameobject.find and just use references
Comment all files
Remove castcontroller? seems extraneous

done:
spell icon graphics
Rework Jump mechanic so that it lags a little at the top. Like a bellcurve for vertical velocity
adding icons for the spell select cursor and the ability cooldowns
camera still messes up when you move the players too close together
	--fixed by making camera y dependent on distance between furthest players
Due to how the player state machine works, pressing the cancel button while holding a spell input button will put the player back into casting mode. 
	--Just make it so that the player can't cast spells if cancel input is being held
Elec spell drains HP incredibly fast after the invinciblity wears off, for some reason
